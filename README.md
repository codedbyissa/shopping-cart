# Shopping cart by issa
One more project to add to my frontend portfolio, a responsive, interactive and dynamic shopping cart. To add a product, just click on the cart in the left corner, if it has already been added +1 is sumed in to your quantity avoiding duplication, in the right corner there is another button in the shape of an ''i'', click on it if you want to receive more information from the product and take a look at its photo gallery. In the cart you can control the amount of products added, delete a product if you want or clear the entire cart at once, in addition, you can have an idea of the total price and the quantity of items in the cart.
